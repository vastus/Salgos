Description
===========
This task is going to focus on the implementation, and analysis of sorting
algorithms. Some of the sorting algorithms will be using abstract datatypes
assisting on how the sorting works; these ADT's will also be implemented.

For example in heap sort the algorithm exploits heavy usage ofa a max heap ADT.


Specification
=============
How the algorithms will be implemented is mainly going to base on the pseudo
code that has been provided in the material that this work will rely on.
Further time and space constraints will be added as the task evolves. 


References
==========
Implementation and analysis will be refering to the material used in 
'Tietorakenteet ja Algoritmit' -course held by Helsingin yliopisto IT Dep.
