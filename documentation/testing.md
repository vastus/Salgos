# Testing

In this project automated tests were written for the implemented sorting
algorithms using JUnit testing library for Java.

The tests are targeted individually for different helper methods the sorts use
and for general sorting that the sort actually works. Tests can be found in
the project's [test][test_dir]-directory.
